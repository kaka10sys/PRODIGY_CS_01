Here's how the program works:

The caesar_cipher function takes three arguments: text, shift, and direction. It iterates over each character in the text and applies the Caesar Cipher algorithm to encrypt or decrypt the character based on the shift value and direction.
The main function provides a simple menu-driven interface for the user to choose between encrypting a message, decrypting a message, or quitting the program.
When the user chooses to encrypt or decrypt a message, they are prompted to enter the message and shift value. The program then calls the caesar_cipher function with the appropriate arguments and prints the resulting encrypted or decrypted message.
You can save this code to a file (e.g., caesar_cipher.py) and run it from the command line using python caesar_cipher.py.
